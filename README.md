# Python-mesh-from-heightmap-generation
This script generates a .OBJ mesh from a heightmap and puts a texture on it (optionally). Made with python 2.7.

If you're making large meshes then I recommend optimizing them with a mesh optimization program like Balancer nPro Lite by Atangeo.

Inside the script are configuration variables. Further instructions are there.
