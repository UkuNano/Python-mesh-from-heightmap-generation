# Python-mesh-from-heightmap-generation
This script generates a .OBJ mesh from a heightmap and puts a texture on it (optionally). Made with python 2.7.
You can make holes in the mesh by making transparent spots to the heightmap.

If you're making large meshes then I recommend optimizing them with a mesh optimization program like Balancer nPro Lite by Atangeo.

Inside the script are configuration variables. Further instructions are there.

With this script you can make 3D terrain for games.
You can view the mesh in 3D mesh editor like Blender for example.
